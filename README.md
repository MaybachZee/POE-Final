7. The RecipeApplication will launch, and the main menu will be displayed.
8. From the main menu, you can interact with the various options to enter new recipes, display recipes, select and view recipe details, scale recipes, reset recipe quantities, and clear all data.
9. Follow the on-screen instructions and user manual for each option to use the Recipe Application effectively.
10. To exit the application, click the "Close" button at the top-right corner of the main menu screen.
